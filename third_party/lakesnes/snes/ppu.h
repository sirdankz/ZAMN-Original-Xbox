// The console draws 256 pixels across a scanline. `extraLeft` and `extraRight`
// are how many more this PPU draws either side of those, so a line runs from
// `-extraLeft` to `255 + extraRight`. The game's coordinate system does not
// move: column 0 is still column 0, scroll registers still mean what they
// meant, and what appears in the margins appears because it was always there
// and the hardware had nowhere to put it.
//
// Both zero is the console, and is the default. Every expression below reduces
// to the original one at zero -- the margins only ever enter as `+ 0` or as a
// loop bound that is still 256 -- which is what lets the co-simulation corpus
// go on meaning what it meant.
//
// The most either side can have. The frontend's widest is 21:9, 96 a side,
// and at the end of a map one side takes both: 192. That is also about as
// wide as this can go. A sprite's X is nine bits, one lap of 512, and the
// picture and a sprite's 16 hanging off its edge have to fit in one lap
// (`ppu_spriteX`): 256 + 192 + 16 is 464. The game's planes are 512 across
// as well, and a picture wider than one comes round onto itself. So 32:9,
// 684 columns, would need more than a bigger number here.
#define PPU_EXTRA_MAX 192

// One row of the pixel buffer, in bytes. Every game pixel is written as two
// side-by-side output pixels of four bytes, because `ppu_handlePixel` fills a
// hi-res row whether or not the mode is hi-res. So this is 8 bytes a game
// pixel, and at zero margins the first 2048 of them are the row this core
// always had.
#define PPU_ROW_BYTES (PPU_MAX_WIDTH * 8)
// Rows a frame can have, including the overscan ones. `ppu_runLine` is called

// and row 0 goes unused.

// How many times a background's horizontal scroll has to change within one
// frame before the layer is read as a raster effect rather than as a scroll.
// Measured over the whole intro and a level: an ordinary layer changes it at
// most four times a frame, and the title logo's per-line sweep changes it on
// every one of the 224 lines. Anywhere in that gap does; this is the middle.
#define PPU_RASTER_WRITES 16

// What a layer does with the margins. The mechanism is here; which layer is
// which is the game's business and is set from outside.
enum {
  // Work it out from the layer, every frame, with no list of screens anywhere.
  //
  // The default answer is the honest one: draw what the hardware would have
  // drawn if the scanline were longer. A background is a tilemap and a scroll,
  // both of which are defined at any x; the console stops at 256 because it
  // runs out of time, not because the map runs out. So `ppu_wideAuto` means
  // `ppu_wideStretch` unless one of two things is true of the layer.
  //
  // The first is that it has *nothing* at the console's edges. A layer whose
  // outermost columns are entirely transparent is a picture that was composed
  // to be seen at one place -- a logo, a card, a screenful of legal text -- and
  // the margins beside it belong to whatever is behind it, which is what the
  // console's own edge column is already showing. That is `ppu_wideClip`, and
  // it is measured in pixels rather than in tilemap words: see
  // `ppu_columnEmpty`.
  //
  // The second is that the map is 64 columns wide while the game maintains only
  // the 32 the console shows. Reading further along that map is reading
  // whatever the VRAM was last used for, which is how a stone wall comes out
  // shredded, so those repeat the 256 columns the game does maintain --
  // `ppu_wideTile`. A layer whose wider map *is* maintained, like a level's
  // scrolling world, is given `ppu_wideStretch` from outside, because for that
  // one the answer is known rather than guessed.
  //
  // The third is a 256-pixel map -- 32 columns of 8-pixel tiles, the width of
  // the console exactly -- that the game has never scrolled sideways. Stretching
  // such a map does not read further along it; there is no further along, so it
  // wraps, and the margins fill with the far end of the same screen. That is
  // right for a layer the game *does* scroll, because then the console is
  // already wrapping it in plain sight and its seam is one an artist has had to
  // make look right: the stone wall drifting behind the LucasArts logo, the
  // wallpaper behind the character select. It is wrong for a layer that has sat
  // still since the screen went up, whose seam nobody has ever seen, and doing
  // it anyway prints the tail of a line of text down the far side of the
  // picture -- which is what the card naming a level did. Those are clipped.
  // See `layerScrolled`: latched per screen rather than tested per frame, so a
  // wall that moves a pixel every fourth frame does not flicker between the two
  // answers, and cleared when the screen is taken down behind a forced blank.
  ppu_wideAuto = 0,
  // Draw it out there the way it is drawn anywhere else. Correct for anything
  // the world scrolls -- the tilemap simply continues.
  ppu_wideStretch,
  // A 256-wide layer that is furniture rather than world: split it down the
  // middle, pin columns 0-127 to the left edge of the widened picture and
  // 128-255 to the right edge, and leave the gap between them transparent. A
  // two-player status panel laid out as two half-width halves lands one half on
  // each edge, which is where a widescreen game would have put them.
  ppu_wideAnchor,
  // Confine it to the console's 256 and let the margins show whatever is
  // behind. The honest answer for a layer whose content stops at the edge.
  ppu_wideClip,
  // Carry the outermost column of the picture out to the edges. Where that
  // column is empty this is `ppu_wideClip` -- a text card on a black field
  // keeps its black -- and where it is not, the margin is that colour rather
  // than a hard cut to the backdrop, which is what a logo centred on a solid
  // panel wants.
  ppu_wideClampEdge,
  // A 256-wide layer that is a whole screen rather than furniture at its two
  // edges: the game over's mask, "GAME OVER" cut out of a solid field. Put
  // its middle at the middle of the widened picture, wherever the console's
  // 256 fall in it -- at the end of a map the two margins are not the same
  // width, and drawn in the console's place the mask sat off to one side --
  // and carry its outermost columns out to the edges as `ppu_wideClampEdge`
  // does, so the field reaches the whole picture.
  ppu_wideCentre,
  // Repeat the console's 256 columns outward, so the margins show the same
  // field again. For a 32-tile tilemap this is what the hardware does anyway --
  // its map wraps every 256 pixels -- and for a wider one it is the point:
  // a 64-column tilemap with only 32 columns ever written has 32 columns of
  // whatever was last in that VRAM, and reading those is how a stone wall comes
  // out shredded. This can only ever show columns the game has actually drawn.
  ppu_wideTile,
  // A layer that is swept across the console from the left: its map begins at
  // column 0, and the game scrolls it from 256 down to 0, so that the map's
  // first 256 columns come in from the left edge and what is at column 256 --
  // the Konami logo's star, with the line behind it -- leaves by the right one.
  // The sweep is the console's width long and the picture is wider, so drawn
  // in place the star would appear inside the picture and stop short of its
  // edge. Instead the layer is drawn shifted by an amount that runs from the
  // left margin's width leftward, with nothing swept in, to the right
  // margin's width rightward, with all of it: the star crosses the whole
  // picture in the time it crossed the console. And left of the map's column
  // 0, where the console never looks, the map is read as column 0 -- the line
  // goes on to the picture's edge, as it went on to the console's.
  ppu_wideSweep,
  // `ppu_wideCentre` without the margins: the layer's 256 columns at the
  // middle of the widened picture and nothing either side of them. Writing
  // across the console rather than a field -- the credit level's lines, on
  // a band the maths window darkens the whole width of -- has nothing at its
  // edges to carry out, and beside it is whatever is behind it.

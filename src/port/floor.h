// What the floor does to whoever is standing on it.
//
//   $80:E86D  floor_effect  0.1%  the tile under the player, and its effect
//   $80:F935                --    the harm it starts, inlined; one call site
//
// `port/terrain.h` answers "can something stand here". This asks the opposite
// question about the tile it is already standing on: it reads one attribute
// word through `$80:ADC8 tile_attrs_at_pixel` and, for five particular values,
// does something to the player. Conveyor belts, the harmful floors, and one
// tile that clears a word. Everything else is a floor you just stand on, and
// the routine returns without touching anything.
//
// It is 13.2 instructions a call over 28,088 calls, and `$80:D1FF` -- the
// player's state-zero handler -- opens with `JSR $E86D` before it looks at a
// single button. **Standing on the ground is checked before the controller
// is.**
//
// ## Five attribute words, and the mask that makes them five
//
// `AND #$FF7F` first, so bit 7 is not part of any comparison -- whatever that
// bit marks, it is orthogonal to the floor's effect and the routine drops it
// rather than testing it. Then, in order:
//
//   $4000   harm, unless the player is carrying weapon 3 with `$1E` set
//   $0400   harm, unconditionally
//   $8000   `STZ $2A`, and nothing else
//   bit 3   a conveyor: fall through to the four direction cases
//
// and the four conveyors, which are the low byte plus that same bit 3:
//
//   $0108   one pixel up          $0208   one pixel left
//   $0408   one pixel down        $0028   one pixel right, if the way is clear
//
// **Only the rightward one is checked against terrain.** The other three write
// `$30` or `$32` outright, so a belt can push a player into a wall going up,
// down or left, and cannot going right. There is no comment in the ROM and no
// obvious reason; the port reproduces the asymmetry rather than rounding it
// off, because a guard on the other three would be a difference from the ROM
// that no input can distinguish from a fix.
//
// ## `BIT #$0008` is not `BIT $0008`
//
// The conveyor test is `BIT` in **immediate** mode, and on the 65816 that form
// sets **Z only** -- N and V are left alone, where every other addressing mode
// would load them from bits 15 and 14 of the operand. So the routine's flags on
// its plainest exit, `$80:E88C RTS`, are Z from the `BIT` and N and C from the
// `CMP #$8000` three instructions earlier. Getting that wrong is invisible
// until a caller branches on N.
//
// ## What `$80:F935` starts, and why it is inlined
//
// Eleven instructions, and **one call site in the whole cartridge** -- this one
// -- so it goes in the body rather than the registry, the same call the
// `blockmap` round made about `$80:AD0B`. Its own span is 4,020 instructions
// over 493 calls, and only 19 of those 493 get past the third branch.
//
//     LDA $70 : CMP #$0002 : BEQ out      ; two modes suppress it entirely
//               CMP #$0004 : BEQ out
//     LDA $52 : BPL out                   ; ...and so does the cooldown
//     LDA #$8001 : STA $50
//     LDA #$0020 : STA $52
//
// `$50` and `$52` are a pair, and `$80:D01B` is where they are read back:
// `BIT $50 : BMI` takes the "an effect is running" branch, which walks an
// animation frame table and clears `$50` at the end of it before going on to
// `$1CB8 player_health`; and `DEC $52 : BPL` counts the other one down, parking
// it at `$FFFF` when it expires. So `$52` negative means *idle*, which is why
// the `BPL` here is a guard rather than a test -- **the floor can only hurt you
// again once the last one has finished** -- and `$0020` is that cooldown.
//
// The port does not name `$70`. Two of its values switch the whole thing off
// and the ROM does not say which two states they are.
//
// ## Direct page, and why it is the caller's
//
// There is no `PHD` anywhere in either routine, so every one of these is a
// field of the **player thread's own page** and not the absolute WRAM address
// the symbol file would give it. `$0E`, `$1E`, `$30` and `$32` in particular
// look like `vbl_queue_*` and `apu_seq` at face value and are nothing of the
// kind -- the same trap the thread bodies sprang, one file over. `$1CBC` is the
// exception and is genuinely absolute: `LDA $1CBC,X` is a 16-bit operand.
//
// No `PHD` also means no `PLD` to take N and Z from, so **the flags come from
// whichever comparison the routine stopped at** -- eleven exits, and the port
// tracks them one at a time.
//
// Port code: libc only.

// The per-frame sprite pass: the display list, and the OAM buffer it fills.
//
// `sprite_build_oam` (`$80:BD1F`) is what the scheduler runs once per pass, and
// it is the routine the whole sprite path hangs off. It opens with three list
// routines, walks whatever survived them, hands each survivor to one of the four
// emitters Phase 2 already ported (`src/assets/sprite.c`), and finishes with a
// pairwise overlap test. All five are here:
//
//   $80:BC7F  actor_depth_sort    one bubble pass over the display list
//   $80:BCE2  actor_cull          list -> visible_actors[], by camera window
//   $80:BC23  oam_buffer_clear    park all 128 OAM entries off screen
//   $80:BEC9  actor_overlap_pass  tell touching pairs about each other
//   $80:BD1F  sprite_build_oam    the pass itself
//
// ...and, at the end of the file, the two routines that put records on the list
// and take them off — `$80:BE0C actor_slot_alloc` and `$80:BE41 actor_slot_free`,
// 143 call sites between them.
//
// Between them they read and write nothing but WRAM and the metasprites in ROM,
// and none of them yields — the pass runs from `scheduler_idle`'s housekeeping,
// not from a thread. Each runs 1,016 times in `movies/level1.zmv`.
//
// One thing here is deliberately unfinished, and it is marked as such rather
// than hidden: when the overlap pass finds a pair it dispatches into the two
// actors' handlers, which is game logic nobody has ported. See
// `actor_overlap_pass` below.
//
// ## The display list
//
// The game keeps **32 records of 20 bytes at `$7E:185E`** — allocated by
// `$80:BE0C`, freed by `$80:BE41`, all 32 cleared by `$80:BDF3` — and chains the
// live ones into a singly-linked list whose head is `$7E:1B5E`. A record is
// addressed by its own WRAM offset: `$12,X` is the link to the next one, and 0
// terminates. Every routine here walks that list.
//
// Only the fields this pass reads are named below. The rest of a record belongs
// to the actor logic, which is not ported yet.
//
// Port code: libc only.

// that -- a sprite is moved a fraction of the way from where its *actor* was a
// tick ago, so every piece of an actor moves together and two zombies standing
// close do not trade pieces. So the pass leaves it here, beside the buffer it
// belongs to. `rec` is the record's WRAM offset, or -1 for an entry the pass
// parked; `ox`/`oy` are the origin the record's pieces were placed from, the

// first; `src/main_sdl.c` and `tools/test_layers.c` both do.

// walk in this file sees. And the *slot* it pushes is found by scanning the 32
// records **downwards** from the last one, `$7E:1ACA`, taking the first with
// `ACTOR_ACTIVE` clear. Two orders, opposite directions, and neither is the
// other's inverse — which is why the list's order says nothing about the array's.
//
// ## `ACTOR_ACTIVE` is the allocation bit
//
// `port/oam.h` has carried a note for several rounds saying that bit 0 of
// `ACTOR_FLAGS` is set on every live record ever sampled and that *what clears
// it had not been established*. `$80:BE41` clears it: `LDA #$0000 : STA
// $0000,Y`, the whole word, as the first thing it does once it has decided the
// free is allowed. And `$80:BE0C` is the only thing that sets it, with `LDA
// #$0001` — a record's flags start at exactly `$0001` and everything else about
// it, including `ACTOR_DRAW`, is written afterwards by whoever asked for it.
//
// So the bit is not a property of a drawn record at all. It is the allocator's
// free-list mark, read by `LSR : BCC` in both routines and by nothing else, and
// the two coverage sites that test it during a *walk* are untaken by all 43
// movies because a record on the list always has it.
//
// ## A free needs the caller's permission slip
//
//     TAY : LDA $0008 : CMP $000C,Y : BNE out
//
// `$0008` is `W_SCHED_CUR_TASK` and `$0C` is `ACTOR_THREAD` — so a record can
// only be freed by the thread that owns it, and every one of the 63 call sites
// is inside the actor whose record it is. Passing another actor's record does
// nothing at all, silently. That is the only ownership check anywhere in the
// port so far.
//
// ## Three exits, three different sources of N and Z
//
// `$80:BE41` is the clearest example yet of the thing this codebase keeps
// running into. Its "not yours" exit leaves the `CMP`'s flags; its "already
// free" exit leaves the `LSR`'s; and its working exit ends `PLD : RTL`, so N
// and Z come off **the caller's own direct page** — the same shape
// `apu_play_sfx` has, and the same instruction.
// The `PHD` is there because the unlink walk uses direct-page addressing with
// `D` forced to zero (`LDA #$0000 : TCD`), which is how a `JSL` from any page
// reaches `$7E:0038` and `$7E:0012,X` without knowing where it came from.
//
// `$80:BE0C` does the same trick one register over: `PHB : PEA $007E : PLB`
// costs a stray byte and the exit pulls twice, so its N and Z are the caller's
// **data bank**. See `port/sprite_cache.h`, which pays for the same idiom.

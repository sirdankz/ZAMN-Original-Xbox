// The player's weapon selection — `$80:EA63` and the small routine it ends
// with.
//
// This is the first ported code that is not on the collision path and not
// per-frame housekeeping: it is a player *doing* something. It arrived here by
// the census, which is the point of having one. `$80:F87B` — a pickup — ends
// with a tail call into `$80:EA63` when the player is holding nothing, that
// decline was the last address left on the list, and following it turned up a
// routine with a second caller that has nothing to do with pickups at all.
//
// **That second caller is a correction to something PROGRESS.md records.** An
// earlier round established that `Y` is the fire button and that `B` "does
// nothing", because holding B for 120 frames moved no counter. `B` does do
// something: `$80:D259  LDA $1A : AND #$8000 : ... : JSR $EA63` is the player's
// input handler cycling to the next weapon. It looked like nothing because a
// player carrying one weapon cycles to the one they are already holding, and
// the routine's first exit is `CMP $1CBC,X : BEQ` — no store, no sound.
//
// The inventory it searches is `W_PLAYER_INVENTORY`, fourteen BCD counters per
// player, and the same array `$80:F87B` adds to. So the two halves of "picking
// something up" — the counter and the selection — are both here and both
// diffed.
//
// Port code: libc only.

// --- $80:D1FF  player_state_normal ------------------------------------------
//
// The player's ordinary frame, and the routine both of the two above are
// reached from. 0.4% of everything the game executes, and until this round it
// was the top portable row on the board.
//
// ## It is a state handler, so the calls column is wrong about it
//
// `$80:D1EC` is `JMP ($D1EF,X)` — a jump table of eight player states, four of
// them live — and 26,972 of this routine's **27,698** entries arrive that way.
// The other 726 are the one real `JSR $D1FF`, at `$80:D40B` inside another
// state. The ranking's call count is a `JSR`/`JSL` count and undercounts the
// entries by 38x.
//
// **The harness does not care**, and that is worth stating rather than
// discovering: `cosim_step` intercepts on `pc == r->entry` and never asks how
// the PC got there, and the closing `RTS` returns to whoever called the
// dispatcher either way. What it does affect is the standing check, which has
// to be read against the routine's span and not against 726.
//
// ## What a frame does, in order
//
//   1. `JSR $E86D floor_effect` — **before a single button is read**;
//   2. the weapon the player is holding, checked against how much of it is
//      left, and one of two flag words set from where it sits in the list;
//   3. the direction latch, `$0072,X` into `$24` and into `$26` if non-zero;
//   4. four edge-triggered buttons;
//   5. four countdowns, each `LDA : BEQ : DEC`, and the fourth clears `$54`
//      when it lands on zero.
//
// The four buttons are all `this frame AND mask` with `last frame AND mask`
// clear, which is an edge and not a level:
//
//     $8000  B   -> $80:EA63 weapon_select_next
//     $0080  A   -> $80:EAA8 item_select_next
//     $0040  X   -> $80:EAE1 item_use          -- the one thing not ported
//     $0030  L or R -> spawn $82:D8DB, and play sound $0D
//
// ## Weapon zero is empty, and the two flag words
//
// `LDY $1CBC,X : BMI` skips everything when the weapon index is negative, and
// then `$1A AND #$4000` gates it on Y being held — so this block only runs
// while the player is trying to fire. `LDA ($64),Y` reads that weapon's BCD
// counter, and:
//
//   * **zero** sets bit 15 of `$006E,X` — the routine writes back to the raw
//     input word, which is the one place in this file where the game modifies
//     what it read from the controller;
//   * **non-zero** clears it, and then files `#$4000` in `$1E` or `$20`
//     depending on where the weapon sits: indices 6..12 in `$20`, everything
//     else in `$1E`. Both were zeroed two instructions into the routine.
//
// `$1E` is the same word `port/floor.h`'s `$4000` floor reads to decide whether
// weapon 3 makes the player immune — so *that* immunity is a weapon that is
// both selected and not empty, and this is where the connection is made.
//
// ## `$80:EAE1 item_use` is not ported, so those calls are declined
//
// It executes **zero times in all ten profiles** and dispatches through a table
// of per-item routines, so porting it would be a large amount of code the
// corpus cannot check. The guard declines instead, and it can, because the
// condition is entirely readable before the routine runs: `$006E,X & $0040`
// set and `$1C & $0040` clear. Bit 15 is the only bit of `$006E,X` the routine
// rewrites, so the guard reading the raw word rather than `$1A` is exact.

// --- Input the console did not have ------------------------------------------
//
// A second stick, and the only thing in this file that is not the ROM's.
// `src/twinstick.h` has the reasoning; the short of it is that `$26` is the shot
// direction, the facing and the firing pose all at once, and it is not the word
// movement uses — so aiming somewhere other than where you are walking is this
// one store going somewhere else.
//
// **This has to live in the port, and not only in the frontend, because the port
// is what runs this routine.** `$80:D1FF` is substituted, so the nine bytes at
// `$80:D250` that `twin_install` patches are never executed in the playable
// build — they are the `--stock` path and the F1 path, and the two have to agree.
// They agree by being the same sentence twice: store the aim in `$26` instead of
// the walk.
//
// Zero is off, which is what the game means by "no direction" as well. Nothing
// in the corpus arms it — `zamn_cosim` never calls this — so with it unarmed
// `player_state_normal` is bit for bit the routine it was, and the diff is
// untouched.
//
// `player` is the doubled index the routine already carries, so 0 and 2.

// --- Selecting backwards, and from a button that is not B or A ----------------
//
// The second thing in this file that is not the ROM's. The cartridge has one
// button for the weapons and one for the items and both only go forwards, which
// with fourteen weapons is thirteen presses to reach the one just passed. A
// modern pad has four things in its top corners, so a frontend gives them two
// directions each: `player_cycle_request`.
//
// **Asked for here and done in `player_state_normal`**, for the reason
// `player_set_aim` is: the selection needs the player's own direct page -- the
// inventory base, the display record whose metasprite bank a new weapon
// rewrites -- and the routine is where that is in hand. A request waits for the
// player's next ordinary frame, one step a frame, and is dropped if none comes
// within `PSN_CYCLE_TTL` frames (`player_cycle_age`): a press made while
// paused or while the player is being carried off should not change weapon
// seconds later.
//
// Forwards is `weapon_select_next` and `item_select_next`, the game's own.
// Backwards is the same search walked the other way, `weapon_select_prev` and
// `item_select_prev`: the nearest non-empty slot below the one held, wrapping,
// the same store, the same weapon data, the same sound, and the same silence
// when the search comes back to where it began.
//
// **It does not go through the button word**, and that is a difference a
// player can feel. The routine clears bit 15 -- which is B -- out of `$1A` for
// as long as fire is held on a weapon that is not empty, so the cartridge
// cannot change weapon while shooting; a request can. The game changes weapon
// under a held fire button itself, whenever one runs dry, so nothing
// downstream is surprised.
//

// The hardware registers, for a routine whose work is writing them.
//
// A vblank job does little else. `$80:B947` sends each sprite's tiles to VRAM
// by filling in DMA channel 0 and starting it, then sends the whole OAM the
// same way, and nearly every instruction in it is a store to `$21xx` or
// `$43xx`. There is nothing in WRAM to compare, and the machine is only right
// if each byte reaches its register in the ROM's order, and each DMA starts on
// the ROM's cycle: a transfer holds the CPU for as long as it runs, and where
// it starts decides where everything after it falls.
//
// So a routine like that does not write the machine. It records what it
// wrote, in order, between the runs of its own instructions: `hw_run` for a
// stretch of the ROM's code, named by a block number the way the other ports
// count theirs, and `hw_w8` for each byte stored to a register. The harness
// prices the runs, so each write has the cycle the ROM's store reaches the bus
// on, and makes the writes on those cycles while the budget is spent. `verify`
// compares every one of them, address, value and cycle, against the ROM's.
//
// A run ends where a store's write begins. A store's own cycles before that,
// its opcode and operand fetches, belong to the run in front of it. A 16-bit
// store is two writes, low byte first, and `hw_w16` records both.
//
// ## Waiting on the SPC700
//
// The sound routines also *read* a register, and only to wait: `CPY $2143 :
// BNE` goes round until the SPC700 has echoed the last command back. How many
// times is the SPC's business, and the port cannot know it. It does not need
// to, because what the routine does after the wait does not depend on how
// long the wait was. So the port records the wait itself, `hw_wait8` or
// `hw_wait16`: the register, and the value that ends it. The harness makes
// the reads on the ROM's cycles while the budget is spent, and each read the
// value does not match costs one more time round the loop, which moves
// everything after it later by exactly that much.
//
// A wait is the whole loop, compare and branch, from the compare's first
// fetch to the end of the branch that falls through. The runs either side of
// it leave both instructions out.
//
// ## Where the stack is
//
// An upload runs for frames and the NMI lands inside it, where the ROM is a
// `JSR` or a `PHP` deep. The handler saves the stack pointer it finds, and
// `thread_spawn` later copies that into a thread's page, so a port that let
// the NMI land at its entry's depth would leave a different number behind.
// `hw_stack` records the stack pointer after each push or pull, and a burn
// that stops for an interrupt puts it there first.
//
// Port code: libc only.

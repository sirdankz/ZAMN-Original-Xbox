// The player's walk: where a player ends up this frame on ordinary ground.
//
// `$80:E4BA` is the movement handler the player's frame calls through `$2A`
// (see `port/bodies.h`, "player_body"). This is that routine as readable C,
// the first piece of the port written that way rather than transliterated.
// It is a function of the player's page and the board, and it calls the
// other movement code as C functions, not through the ROM.
//
// ## What the walk does
//
// The pad has already set a direction and a speed. The walk asks where that
// takes the player (`step_propose`, `port/step.h`), and then tries the move
// one axis at a time: across first, then up or down. Trying the axes apart is
// what lets a player slide along a wall instead of stopping dead against it.
//
// Each axis is put to four questions, in this order, and the first that
// refuses stops that axis for this frame:
//
//   1. Is the ground there solid?            `terrain_blocked`
//   2. Is it too far from the other player?  `step_tether_blocked`
//   3. Is someone standing there?            `actor_obstacle_at_point`
//   4. Is it off the map?                    `terrain_out_of_bounds`
//
// Two of them have a second part.
//
// * **Solid ground can have a reaction of its own.** The tile's attribute
//   word names one of six (`walk_tile_reaction`). Those belong to other parts
//   of the game, such as doors, and this file does not handle them. Ground
//   without one is only solid, and that is 98% of the solid tiles in play.
// * **Someone standing there only blocks a player who is standing clear.**
//   If someone is also standing where the player is now, the step goes ahead.
//   Two actors that already overlap can walk apart, and nothing holds a player
//   in place.
//
// ## Its contract with the ROM
//
// The port still runs inside the emulator, so what the walk hands back must
// be what the ROM's routine would have left. It writes WRAM exactly as the
// ROM does, including the scratch the four tests use. Of the registers, the
// frame after the walk keeps only carry and overflow, which `thread_yield`
// pushes into the thread's saved status byte. `WalkLog` carries those two,
// and what the call cost the 65816, to the harness. The walk itself never
// reads the log.
//
// Neither is tidy. Carry is the answer to the last question asked, which is
// clear after "someone is standing here too" and set after every other stop.
// Overflow is whatever the last add in the tests left, and on the big maps of
// levels 19 and 25 the tilemap address `terrain_blocked` adds up sets it.
//
// Two paths are the ROM's, and `walk_supported` says when:
//
// * the double step, bit 15 of `$54`, which runs the whole walk twice. No
//   input has taken it.
// * a solid tile with a reaction of its own. The reaction takes over from
//   inside the walk, and it is not ported.
//
// Port code: libc only.

// $80:C7D9 — crediting a player with points.
//
// The collision path arrives here through a death: `$81:8727` puts the award in
// X and the collision id in A, and an enemy that has just run out of health
// calls it. It is not only the collision path's, though, and that is why it is
// registered as a routine in its own right rather than left inside
// `enemy_collide` — `$83:A1D5`, the victim-rescue thread, calls it too, from a
// completely unrelated part of the game. A routine checked on one of its two
// call sites is checked half as hard as one checked on both.
//
// Three things about it are worth knowing before reading the code.
//
// **The score is BCD.** `SED` is on for the whole addition, so the port has to
// do decimal arithmetic rather than binary. `score_bcd_add16()` below is the
// 65816's own algorithm written out, not a decode-add-reencode: the two agree on
// valid BCD and disagree on everything else, and the harness compares the answer
// byte for byte.
//
// **Which player gets the points is a lookup, not an index.** The caller does
// not name a player; it hands over a *side*, which is 0 or 2 depending on the
// sign bit of the collision id — so bit 15 of an enemy's collision argument says
// which player's weapon caused it, and bits 0-14 say what the weapon was. The
// side is then searched for in the two words at `$7E:1E84`, which say which side
// owns each of the two score slots. `$80:925D` seeds them 0 and 2, the identity;
// finding a side in neither is a real answer and means the points are dropped.
//
// **The addition is 32-bit but reached through a jump table.** The two score
// slots are laid out identically four bytes apart, but the ROM branches to two
// separate copies of the code rather than indexing, and the table it branches
// through is in ROM at `$80:C819`. This reads that table rather than
// transcribing its targets, for the reason `player_collide` does: a ROM hack
// that repoints it works, and an entry the port does not have declines by
// address instead of being silently mishandled.
//
// Port code: libc only.

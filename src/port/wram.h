// The game's RAM, as the port sees it.
//
// This is the single most important decision in Phase 3, so it is worth being
// explicit about: **the port keeps the SNES's WRAM layout, byte for byte.**
// Ported routines do not operate on tidy C structs of their own invention; they
// read and write the same 128 KB the 65816 code does, at the same offsets.
//
// That is what makes the co-simulation harness possible at all. `Wram` is
// layout-compatible with the reference core's `snes->ram`, so the harness can
// point a ported routine straight at the emulator's memory, or at a snapshot of
// it, and then diff the result byte-for-byte against what the ROM's own routine
// produced. A port that invented its own state layout could only be checked by
// eye.
//
// It costs less than it sounds. The addresses are already named — every symbol
// below is one from `tools/symbols/zamn.sym`, established from traced execution
// (see `docs/wram-map.md`) — and once the whole of Phase 3 is done, "the game
// state" is exactly this array, which is what makes PLAN.md's Phase 5 save
// states a one-line `fwrite`.
//
// Addressing: WRAM is banks `$7E` and `$7F`. Offset `$00000-$0FFFF` is
// `$7E:0000-$7E:FFFF` and `$10000-$1FFFF` is `$7F:0000-$7F:FFFF`.
//
// Direct page is `$0000` for the scheduler, NMI and the per-frame housekeeping,
// so a direct-page operand `$xx` in one of those routines is literally offset
// `$00xx` here — which is every address named below. It is **not** zero inside a
// thread: each of the 24 runs on its own 128-byte page in `$7E:0100-$7E:0CFF`,
// and an actor's state is that page. Those fields are named in
// `port/collide.h`, as offsets rather than addresses. See
// `docs/frame-skeleton.md` and `docs/wram-map.md`.
//
// Port code: libc only.

// Which of the port's branches has any input actually taken?
//
// `zamn_cosim verify` answers one question very well: does the port compute
// what the ROM computes, on the calls this movie made. It cannot answer the
// question underneath it — *did this movie ever make a call that reaches this
// line*. A branch no input takes is transcribed from the listing and nothing
// more, and the diff will agree with the ROM about it forever, because neither
// one runs it.
//
// `docs/cosim.md` records four such branches. Every one of them was found by
// hand: change the port on purpose, run `verify`, and notice that it still
// passes. That method works and it found real gaps, but it is manual, it is
// destructive, and nobody is going to remember to redo all of it each time a
// movie is added — which is exactly when the answer changes.
//
// So the port marks its decision points and the harness counts them. The rule
// is the one the shims' flag masks already follow, one step further out: an
// unclaimed output is an unchecked output, and **an untaken branch is an
// unverified branch**. Both should be visible rather than assumed.
//
// A mark is not an assertion and never changes what the port computes. It says
// "reaching here is a distinct thing the game can do, and if no input ever does
// it, the code below is unproven". Sites are deliberately sparse: one per
// decision the *diff* would have to run to check, not one per `if`.
//
// This is an instrument, not game logic. With `PORT_COVERAGE` undefined every
// mark compiles to nothing at all — no counters, no storage, no code — which is
// how the finished game builds. The harness's CMake target defines it.
//
// Port code: libc only. This header does not even need that.

// `$80:AD2B blockmap_expand` has none either, and for the same reason:
// `src/port/levelmap.c` is written, one call is about six frames long, and the
// harness abandons every one of them. Its helper `$80:ACF6` is registered and
// has no sites of its own because it has no branches at all -- seven
// instructions, straight through.
//
// The two "nothing selected" paths inside `$80:C5C2` and `$80:C666` have no
// sites, and that one is not about frames. Both are live 65816 code with a
// `BMI` in front of them, and both are unreachable: each is reached only from
// adapters that have already branched on the same word. `src/port/hud.c` does
// not implement either, so there is nothing to mark — and a mark would have sat
// in the untaken list forever describing a thing no input can do, which is the
// same trap `src/port/apu.c` fell into once and was pulled back out of.
//
// `$80:CD20 lzss_decompress` has no sites here on purpose. `src/port/lzss.c` is
// written and is not registered — the harness cannot check a routine that
// outlives a frame, and `src/cosim/routines.c` says why at length. A site for a
// routine nothing calls is untaken forever, and three of those would quietly
// inflate the one number this file exists to keep honest.

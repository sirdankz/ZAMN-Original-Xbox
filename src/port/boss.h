//   $82:92D6  boss_stomp         0.1%   ...and what it does to anything under it
//
// `port/bossbg.h` draws the figure and `port/collide.h` lets it be shot. This
// is the third side of the same object: where it is allowed to be. The position
// it moves is not in an actor record at all -- big figures keep theirs in two
// fixed words, `$1E62` and `$1E64`, with the draw offsets `$82:892E` derives
// from them in the two words after -- and eight routines across banks `$82` and
// `$83` write that pair, so this slot belongs to whichever oversized thing the
// level has rather than to level 25's baby in particular.
//
// The other two arrived here rather than in a file of their own because they
// are the same object seen from the same two words. `boss_step` writes `$1E62`
// and `$1E64` and the mirror flag `$36`; `boss_place_parts` reads all three and
// `boss_stomp` reads the first two. One thread runs the three of them in that
// order, once a frame, and the loop is four instructions long:
//
//     $82:958C  JSR $9265 : JSR $92D6 : JSR $93C6
//     $82:9595  LDA #$0001 : JSL thread_yield
//
// ## Not `step_propose`
//
// `$80:E450` proposes a destination and leaves somebody else to accept it. This
// routine proposes, tests and **commits**, all three, and it commits the two
// axes separately -- which is the whole point of it.
//
// A direction in `$16` picks an eight-byte record from `$82:906F`: the delta,
// the facing flag to leave in `$36`, and a loop count that is `$0008` for the
// four diagonals and `$0000` for the four cardinals. The loop runs once per
// axis the direction actually uses, and each pass tests one edge of the
// figure's footprint and commits that axis alone if the edge is clear. So a
// boss walking north-east into a north wall still goes east. **Sliding along a
// wall is not a special case here; it is what falling out of one of two
// independent passes looks like.**
//
// ## The footprint is two probes, not a rectangle
//
// The second table, at `$82:9035`, holds four signed offsets per entry: two
// points, tested with `$82:90F7 terrain_blocked_wide`, and both must be clear.
//
//     north   (-18,  0) (18,  0)      the top corners
//     east    ( 18,  4) (18, 20)      the right edge
//     south   (-18, 18) (18, 18)      the bottom corners
//     west    (-18,  4) (-18, 20)     the left edge
//
// The origin is the top centre of something 36 wide and about 20 tall. Note
// that the vertical pairs span y 0..18 and the horizontal pairs span y 4..20 --
// the box the game tests is not quite the same box in both directions, and
// nothing rounds it off. Four probes would have been a rectangle; two are a
// leading edge, which is all a mover needs and half the terrain lookups.
//
// The table has **five** entries for four directions, and the fifth repeats the
// first. That is not padding: the index is a base from `$82:905D` plus the loop
// counter, and north-west's base is the last one, so its diagonal pass has to
// find north at the end of the table rather than by wrapping to the start.
//
// And the axis a pass commits is **bit 3 of that same index** -- `$0A AND
// #$0008` -- which works only because the entries are eight bytes and alternate
// vertical, horizontal, vertical, horizontal. One table, indexed once, decides
// both which two points to test and which coordinate to write.
//
// ## `#$6969` in A means double speed
//
// The caller's argument is a magic word, not a flag: `CMP #$6969` and nothing
// else. When it matches, `$40` is added to the record index, which selects the
// second half of the same table -- the same eight directions with the deltas
// doubled -- and `$2C` is decremented.
//
// **Nothing in the boss's own thread reads that counter back.** Bank `$82` has
// five instructions that read direct-page `$2C`: two inside the blitters in
// `port/bossbg.h`, which store to it before every use, two at `$82:A494` and
// `$82:A517` that are seeded by a store four instructions earlier, and one at
// `$82:EF49` -- `LDA $2C : JSL $80:8353`, a yield count -- in a routine nowhere
// near the boss and with a direct page this routine never sets.
//
// So the write is *probably* dead and the port does not claim it is. It
// reproduces it, because the direct page is the caller's and the harness
// compares 128 KB of WRAM after every call, which settles the question without
// anyone having to answer it.
//
// ## Carry means it is stuck
//
// The routine ends by comparing both coordinates against the copies it saved on
// the way in and setting the carry only if **neither** moved. Six of its eight
// call sites branch on that, and three of them -- `$82:8A60`, `$8A68`, `$8A70`
// -- are the same double step written out three times in a row, stopping at the
// first that gets nowhere. When it does get nowhere the caller reaches for the
// RNG and picks a different direction, so this carry is the entire reason a
// cornered boss does not simply stand there grinding against a wall.
//
// ## Index zero is the ROM's own guard
//
// `$16` is a direction times eight and both tables are sized exactly for
// `$00..$40`, with nothing between the last entry and `terrain_blocked_wide`'s
// first instruction. A direction out of range would read code as coordinates.
// The port does not add a check, because entry zero of the delta table is four
// zero words -- no movement, no facing change, one pass, carry set -- which is
// a working "stay put" and reads like the intended floor rather than an
// accident. Anything above `$40` the port reads exactly where the ROM would.
//
// Port code: libc only.

//
// **A figure that has no sprite of its own still needs somewhere to be hit.**
//
// The big figure is drawn out of background tiles by `port/bossbg.h`, so there
// is no actor record under it and nothing for `actor_overlap_pass` to find. The
// thread's opening sequence buys four records instead --
//
//     $82:9531  JSR $94B4 : STX $24 : JSR $94B4 : STX $26
//     $82:953B  JSR $94B4 : STX $28 : JSR $94B4 : STX $2A
//
// -- and this routine is what keeps them under the drawing: once a frame it
// writes `ACTOR_X` and `ACTOR_Y` of all four from `W_BOSS_X`/`W_BOSS_Y` plus a
// fixed offset. Nothing else about the four is touched here; they are hitboxes
// on a string.
//
// ## The offsets are a diagonal, and only X is mirrored
//
// X comes from a table and Y is four constants written into the code:
//
//     part    dx (facing east)   dx (facing west)   dy
//     $24         -14                 +14           -6
//     $26          -4                  +4            0
//     $28         +10                 -10           +4
//     $2A         +20                 -20          +12
//
// So the four sit on a line running down and to the right of the figure's
// origin, and the mirror flips that line about the vertical without touching
// the heights -- which is what `boss_step` writing `$36` is for and the only
// thing this routine reads out of direct page besides the four record pointers.
// The X table holds both halves back to back and the selector is the index
// `LDY #$0000` or `LDY #$0008`, so **"mirrored" is a second table rather than a
// negation**. The eight entries do happen to be four exact negative pairs, and
// the port still reads all eight: a hack that gave the figure a lopsided reach
// by editing four of those bytes would keep working.
//
// **`W_BOSS_Y` is read four separate times**, once per part, and the port keeps
// all four rather than hoisting the load. Whether that could make a difference
// is not the question a transcription answers: `LDA $1E64` appears four times

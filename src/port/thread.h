// The cooperative scheduler's bookkeeping, and the two vblank job queues.
//
// ZAMN's frame is driven by a 24-slot cooperative thread scheduler and two
// queues of jobs that NMI runs — see `docs/frame-skeleton.md`. The scheduler
// itself is not a function that returns, because `thread_yield` leaves into
// another thread on another stack. It is in `port/sched.h`, written over the
// whole register set, with the two dispatchers and the NMI handler.
//
// What is here is the bookkeeping around it: the routines that walk these
// tables and return. They are leaves, they are pure WRAM, and porting them is
// how the harness got exercised against both return kinds —
// `thread_tick_waits` returns with `RTS`, the two queue adders with `RTL`.
//
// Port code: libc only.

// **How a thread gets its first stack frame**, and the exact counterpart of
// `enemy_survived_react` in `port/collide.h`: that one splices a call into a
// thread that already exists, this one manufactures the whole parked state of a
// thread that does not.
//
// Everything the scheduler needs to resume a thread is nine bytes on that
// thread's own stack, because `$80:8390` resumes one with
//
//     LDA $11B0,X : TCS : PLD : PLP : PLB : RTL
//
// — so `thread_spawn` writes a D, a P, a DB and a far return address that lands
// on the entry point, and under that a second far return address to
// `$80:833E`, which is where a thread body's own `RTL` goes to free the slot.
// A brand-new thread and a thread parked in the middle of `thread_yield` are
// the same nine bytes; the only difference is what is in them.
//
// The routine is also how a spawner passes arguments: its last act is to copy
// the **caller's first five direct-page words** into the new thread's page
// (`$80:82B5  LDA ($01,S),Y`, reading through the `D` the opening `PHD` saved).
// `$80:FA26` is the example — it fills `$00`, `$02` and `$04` with a position
// and then spawns.
//
// `entry` and `bank` are the far address to start at, and `caller_dp` is the
// page those five words come from. Returns the slot index already doubled, or
// -1 when all 24 slots are live — which the ROM reports as `A = 0`, and so
// cannot be told from slot 0. The search runs downwards from slot 23, so slot 0
// is the last one taken and that collision is very nearly unreachable.

// Two ceilings, and they are different kinds of thing. The second is the
// scheduler's: eighteen live threads out of the twenty-four slots
// `thread_spawn` hands out, so six are held back for whatever is not an actor.
// The first is `W_SPAWN_LOAD` against 138, and that one is a **weighted**
// census — see `port/wram.h`. An actor charges its own weight when it spawns
// and refunds it when it dies, over 137 sites and 21 distinct weights running
// from 1 to 40, so 138 is not a population but a load: what it limits is how
// much the board is *worth* rather than how much of it there is.
//
// ## The wait loop this is the condition of
//
// `$81:80EC actor_list_spawn` is where it shows: it walks a level's spawn list
// and, before each entry,
//
//     LDA #$0001 : JSL thread_yield : JSL $809D5B : BCS back
//
// — a frame at a time, forever, until the board has room. That is why the
// routine is called 37,151 times for far fewer actors than that: most calls are
// a *refusal*, and the spawner's answer to a refusal is to sleep a frame and
// ask again. A spawn list is therefore not a schedule; it is a queue that
// drains at whatever rate the players clear the board.
//
// ## Both compares are `CMP`, so both are unsigned and both can be equal
//
// `BCS` is taken on equal, so 138 and 18 are the first *refused* values, not the
// last accepted ones. The carry a caller reads back is whichever compare ran
// last, which is the first one only when it refused — and that is the whole
// return value. A and the flags are the same word looked at twice.

// The monster's chase: one frame of going after whoever is nearest.
//
// `$81:BEE3` is one of the state bodies of the monster's thread (see
// `port/monster.h`), the one `monster_seek` installs when something comes
// within `$B4`. The thread reaches it through `$12` by a computed `RTS`, as it
// reaches all its states, and it returns to the thread's loop with an `RTS`.
// This is that body as readable C. It calls the scan, the bearing, the random
// number generator and the terrain and actor tests as C functions.
//
// ## What the chase does
//
// Each frame it looks for the nearest of the four kinds of actor
// `actor_nearest` knows about.
//
// * **Nothing within `$B4`: it gives up.** It picks one of the four straight
//   directions at random and hands over to the wander state at `$81:BE14`,
//   which walks that way.
// * **Otherwise it takes one step towards it.** If the target lies straight
//   up, down, left or right, that is the way it steps. If the target lies on a
//   diagonal, it closes the smaller of the two gaps first, which lines it up
//   with the target. On about half its frames, as the random number
//   generator falls, the step is two pixels instead of one.
//
// The step is refused by solid ground or by anyone standing where it lands. A
// monster blocked by someone waits. A monster blocked by ground looks for a
// tile it can leap: one tile ahead or two, a tile with attribute bit 13, and
// clear ground 48 to 56 pixels beyond it. With all three it leaps, which is a
// state of its own at `$81:BD01` and is not ported. Without them it waits.
//
// ## Directions
//
// The game numbers them 1 for up and then clockwise to 8 for up-left, with 0
// for none. `actor_bearing` answers in those numbers and the step tables are
// indexed by them. Odd numbers are the straight ones.
//
// ## Its contract with the ROM
//
// It writes WRAM exactly as the ROM does, scratch included. Of the registers,
// nothing the chase leaves is read, and the reason is worth keeping.
//
// The thread's loop follows the chase with `monster_seek` or
// `monster_deliver`. Both begin with arithmetic that sets N, Z and C before
// anything reads them. `monster_seek`'s is `actor_nearest`, which runs an
// `ADC` only for an actor it matches. After a step it matches the one the
// chase just found, because nothing between the two calls changes who is on
// the board. After giving up, it may match nobody. Overflow can then survive
// to the thread's next `PHP`, so the give-up path hands back the random number
// generator's V, and only that path does.
//
// Leap setup remains the ROM's. The runtime now uses the logged registers to
// resume at $81:BCF1 after native probing; chase_supported remains available
// to callers that require a complete return instead of that handoff.
//
// Port code: libc only.

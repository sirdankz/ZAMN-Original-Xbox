//
// The source steps by `W_TILEMAP_ROW_BYTES` and the destination by two, which
// is what makes it a *column*: a vertical strip of the map laid out flat.
//
// **`$DC` again, doing its third job.** `CMP $DC : BCS` forces bit 13 — the
// PPU's BG priority bit — on every tile whose nine-bit index is below
// `W_TILE_PRIORITY_BELOW`. `src/assets/level.h` first had this field as a
// draw-time flag, `$82:90F7` showed it is also a collision threshold, and here
// is the draw-time half in the flesh: the tiles that get drawn in front of the
// player are exactly the tiles nothing is allowed to stand on, and one word in
// the level record decides both.
//
// The loop is `DEX : BNE`, so it is a do-while and a count of zero means 65,536
// iterations rather than none. Faithfully reproduced rather than guarded
// against — the ROM would do the same, and a guard here would be the port
// disagreeing with it about something no caller does.

//
//   1. refuse, if the camera is already against that edge of the map;
//   2. move it one pixel, and the sub-tile remainder with it;
//   3. every eighth pixel — when the remainder wraps — advance the tilemap
//      cursor, copy the strip of map that has just come into view, and queue it.
//
// **They are two routines written twice.** `$80:A70A` and `$80:A816` are not in
// the listing as code at all — no label, no disassembly, just `.db` runs the
// tracer never proved were instructions — and decoding them by hand is what
// shows why: each is its partner byte for byte with six substitutions. So this
// file has one X scroller and one Y scroller, parameterised by exactly those
// six differences, which is the shortest honest way to write down a mirror:
//
//   direction   `DEC A`, and `BEQ` against zero          | `INC A`, `CMP $B8`
//   limit       nothing to compare against               | `$B8` / `$B6`

//   edge        the near tile-window word ($1B6E/$1B72)  | the far one
//   destination the cursor itself ($1B76/$1B7A)          | the cursor's end
//
// The last two are the same fact twice: a strip appears at whichever edge the
// camera is moving towards, and it is written at whichever end of the tilemap
// cursor's wrap that edge currently maps to.
//
// **The X pair and the Y pair split their work differently, and the tilemap's
// geometry is why.** A column is 32 tiles and the tilemap is 32 rows tall, so a
// column always wraps somewhere and the X scrollers call `$80:A5E5` twice —
// once for the part below the wrap, once for the part above — into one buffer
// they allocated themselves, and queue **one** transfer. A row is 33 tiles
// across a tilemap 64 wide split into two screens `$400` apart, so the Y
// scrollers copy the row once, with `$80:A61D` allocating for them, and queue
// **two** transfers at unrelated addresses. Same job, opposite shapes.
//
// Two details of the arithmetic are worth stating because a natural
// transcription gets them wrong:
//
// **`ADC $5E : ADC $1B7E` has no `CLC` between the two adds**, so the second one
// carries the first's out. Both destinations in a Y scroll are built that way.
//
// **The unconditional column copy cannot be the 65,536-iteration case.** The

// be zero; the other takes `32 - (cursor & 31)`, which is 1..32 and never zero,
// so `$80:A5E5`'s do-while is safe without a test.
//
// On the way out A, N and Z belong to `$80:9E6D` — the last thing any of the
// four calls — X is the queue's new entry count and Y the doubled cursor the
// destination table was indexed with. Carry is the last `ADC $1B7E`. The two
// early exits publish something different again, and the *first* exit of the

// **One pixel, whatever the distance**, which is why the view drifts after the
// players instead of snapping to them — the delta is computed and then only its
// *sign* is used. `ASL A : BCC` is that sign test: the shift puts bit 15 into
// carry, so carry set means the target is behind the camera. The magnitude is
// thrown away in the same instruction that reads the sign.
//
// **The midpoint truncates.** `LDA ($D2),Y : CLC : ADC ($D4),Y : LSR A` shifts
// A alone, so the carry out of a sum over `$FFFF` is discarded rather than
// shifted back in. No pair of player positions can reach that, and the port
// wraps anyway, because the day one can is not the day to find out the port
// disagreed.
//
// **`$0080` and `$0084` are not the screen's centre.** 128 across is, but 132
// down is eight pixels below the middle of a 224-line screen — the playfield
// sits under a status bar and this is where its centre actually falls.
//
// Its two `SEC`s in a row are not decoration either: `SBC #$0080` can borrow,
// so the second subtract needs carry set again before it runs.
//
// Every exit is `PLD : SEC : RTL`, so **carry is always set and N and Z always
// describe the caller's direct page** — this is a `PHD` routine like
// `step_tether_blocked`, and its flags say nothing about what it did. A comes
// back as the Y delta, or zero on the two exits that never compute one; X is
// that delta too, unless a scroll routine overwrote it; and Y is `$0006` — the
// index the record read left behind — unless one did.
#define CAMERA_FOLLOW_ENTRY 0x80a93fu

// `BIT $26 : BVS`, and `$80:9E7B vram_queue_flush` opens with the same test — so
// bit 14 is a deliberate freeze: with it set the camera does not move and the
// VRAM queue does not drain.
//
// **It is set at `$80:AB8D` and cleared at `$80:ABCC`**, by `LDA #$4000 : TSB
// $26` and `LDA #$4000 : TRB $26` around a bulk tilemap blit — one routine
// holding the view still while it rewrites what the view is looking at, and
// then asking for the transfer itself on the way out. Neither instruction is in
// `analysis/bank_80.asm` as code; the whole routine is a `.db` run, and this
// was found by scanning the ROM image for the four opcodes that can write `$26`
// rather than by reading the listing. A grep of the disassembly said the bit
// had no writer at all, which is what a grep of a disassembly is worth in a
// bank this partly-decoded.

// The big monster's walk cycle, and what it does with what it is carrying.
//
//   $81:C16B  monster_anim          advance the walk, pick a frame, set the flip
//   $81:C00B  monster_place_carried put the held record where the facing says
//   $81:BB75  monster_seek          is anything worth chasing, and is anyone left
//   $81:BBA4  monster_deliver       am I home yet, and is anything worth chasing
//
// `port/collide.h` already has this creature's two collision handlers —
// `$81:C4A6 monster_collide` and `$81:C440 monster_c440_collide`, the same
// thing one stage apart — and calls it "the monster side, the one that takes
// objects out from under the player". These two are the other half of it: the
// per-frame work its thread does between yields, which is drawing and carrying
// rather than colliding.
//
// The thread is at `$81:C201`, and it opens by charging **28** to `W_SPAWN_LOAD`
// — the fifth-heaviest weight of the twenty-one in that census — installing
// `$81:C440` as its collision handler and then looping on
// `thread_yield : JSR $BB75 : JSR $C16B`. So one of these two runs every frame
// the creature is alive, 11,862 times over the corpus, which is why a routine
// this small is worth a registry slot.
//
// ## Facing is a doubled direction and it is used at three different scales
//
// `$14` is the facing already doubled, the currency `step_propose`'s `$24` and
// `actor_step_bearing`'s argument are both in: `$00` still, then clockwise from
// up in twos to `$10`. This file multiplies it by two again into `$2C` and by
// four again into the frame index, and the three scales are what the two tables
// are indexed at:
//
//   * `$2C = $14 * 2` indexes `$81:C026`, four bytes of `{i16 dx, i16 dy}` per
//     direction — where the carried record is held.
//   * `(($14 * 2) | phase) * 2` indexes `$81:C1B1`, eight bytes of four
//     metasprite pointers per direction — the walk cycle.
//
// The `ORA` is a concatenation only because `$14 * 2` has its low two bits
// clear, which is exactly the statement that `$14` is already doubled. Written
// as an `ORA` rather than an `ADC` it is also the ROM asserting that: an `ORA`
// that overlapped would silently pick another direction's frames.
//
// ## Nine directions, four sprite sets, and the mirror
//
// The frame table has nine groups and they are not nine drawings. Up has its
// own; down and "not moving" share one; the six diagonals and the two
// horizontals share a third — and the three west-facing groups are the *same
// pointers* as the three east-facing ones. What tells them apart is the flip:
//
//     CPX #$0030 : BCS + : LDA $0000,Y : AND #$FFFD : STA $0000,Y
//     + : LDA $0000,Y : ORA #$0002 : STA $0000,Y
//
// `$30` is the sixth group, so directions `$0C`, `$0E` and `$10` — down-left,
// left and up-left — get `ACTOR_FLIP`'s bit 1 set and the other six get it
// cleared. Four sprite sets and a mirror is the whole of an eight-way walk.
//
// ## The asymmetry at the two exits
//
// The mirrored path **returns without calling `$81:C00B`**, and the unmirrored
// one falls into it. So on the frame a west-facing monster advances its walk
// cycle, whatever it is carrying is not repositioned — it catches up on the
// next frame, when the timer has not expired and the `BPL` takes the same
// shortcut into `$C1A1` with `$2C` still holding the facing from before. The
// carried record therefore trails the monster's facing by up to one frame, in
// one half of the compass and not the other. That is what the ROM does; why it
// is written that way is not recorded anywhere and is not guessed at here.
//
// Port code: libc only.

// --- $81:BB75 and $81:BBA4  the two states that decide where it goes ---------
//
// The creature's thread is a small state machine, and `monster_anim` above is
// the half of each state that draws. These two are the other half. Four of its
// state bodies open with a pair of `JSR`s and nothing else:
//
//     $81:C226  JSR $BB75 : JSR $C16B    the wander
//     $81:C2BB  JSR $BBA4 : JSR $C16B    ...carrying somebody home
//     $81:C355  JSR $BB75 : JSR $C16B
//     $81:C3DF  JSR $BB75 : JSR $C16B
//
// so three of the four decide where to go with `$81:BB75` and the carrying one
// uses `$81:BBA4`. The chase itself, at `$81:BEE3`, is a fifth body and is not
// built this way. It is in readable C in `port/chase.h`.
//
// ## The state word, and the `JMP` that is really a `JSR`'s tail
//
// A state body is entered by a computed `RTS`, not a call:
//
//     $81:C21E  PEA $C225 : LDA $12 : DEC A : PHA : RTS
//
// so `$12` holds the address of the next body and the `DEC` is the off-by-one
// an `RTS` needs. Both routines here **end by writing that word and returning**,
// via a two-instruction stub they share:
//
//     $81:BEDA  JMP $BEDD
//     $81:BEDD  LDA #$BEE3 : STA $12 : RTS
//
// It is reached by `JMP` and not `JSR`, so the `RTS` at `$81:BEE2` is the one
// that returns to whoever called `$81:BB75` — the stub is a tail, and a routine
// with three exits therefore has its `RTS` in three different places. The
// harness only needs one of them (`CosimRoutine::ret_op` is where a substituted
// call is *sent*, and the return is detected by address and stack pointer), so
// this costs the port nothing but is why the entry names an address inside the
// routine rather than the obvious last instruction.
//
// **A is `$BEE3` on that path**, which is a real output: the caller does not
// read it, but it is the only exit of the four that leaves the high bit set.

// Two questions asked of the same 32-slot scan, at two ranges.
//
//     dist = actor_nearest(x, y)
//     dist <  $B4 and not carrying  ->  chase it
//     dist <  $B4 and carrying      ->  do nothing
//     dist in [$B4, $D0)            ->  do nothing
//     dist >= $D0                   ->  is *either player* within $D0?
//                                       if not, INC $2A and the thread ends
//
// The gap between `$B4` and `$D0` is not hysteresis — nothing here is a state
// with an exit condition, and the routine is re-entered from scratch every
// frame. It is a dead band: **something 180 to 207 pixels away neither starts a
// chase nor counts as the board being empty**, so the monster stands there.
//
// ## The two ranges are asking about different populations
//
// `actor_nearest` looks at four collision ids — the two players, `$38` and
// `$01` — and `player_in_range` looks at exactly the two players. So the near
// test can be satisfied by something that is not a player at all, and the far
// test cannot. That asymmetry is the whole behaviour: the creature will walk
// towards any of the four, and it gives up and leaves only when **both players**
// are more than `$D0` away. A board with a player at `$D1` and a `$38` at `$40`
// takes the near exit and never reaches the give-up test at all.
//
// `$2A` is incremented rather than set, and the thread reads it as
// `LDA $2A : BEQ` at the bottom of its loop — so one frame with nobody in range
// is enough. It is also the same word a `BPL` later decides the *manner* of the
// exit by: positive, as an increment from zero leaves it, takes the quiet path
// that skips the drop and the sound effect. Something else writes it negative;
// that writer is not in this file.

// — a square, tested as two independent absolute differences and not a radius —
// whatever is being carried is freed, `$28` goes back to `$FFFF` and `$26` to
// zero, which is the monster reaching its lair and dropping the victim in it.
//
// The check is `|dx| < $10 && |dy| < $10 && $28 != $FFFF`, in that order, and
// all three failures land on the same instruction. There is no coverage site
// distinguishing "not home" from "home but empty", because there is no
// behavioural difference: both fall through to the second half.
//
// ## The second half is `monster_seek`'s tail, one test short
//
// From `$81:BBD6` the two routines are the same four instructions — clear the
// target, scan, chase anything inside `$B4` — with two differences, and both
// are tests this one leaves out.
//
// It **does not test `$26`**. `monster_seek` refuses to start a chase while the
// creature is holding something; this one does not ask, so a monster still
// carrying a victim across the level will drop into the chase state the moment
// anything comes within `$B4` — with `$28` still pointing at whoever it is
// holding. Nothing here undoes that, and the drop-at-home test it just failed
// is the only thing that would have.
//
// It **has no far test** either, so `$2A` is never incremented from this state

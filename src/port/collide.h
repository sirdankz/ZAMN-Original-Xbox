// The door into actor behaviour: the callback dispatcher, and every handler a
// collision on the current movies reaches.
//
// `port/oam.h` ends at `actor_collide_notify` (`$80:BE8F`), which hands a
// touching pair to `$80:8480` twice — once per actor. That was once where the
// port stopped, and `zamn_cosim` measured the size of the hole rather than
// filling it: on `movies/level1-rescue.zmv` **1,226 of 1,226** collisions enter
// a handler. The census then named the handlers one at a time, and the five
// below were the first of them:
//
//   $80:8480  thread_call_handler  build the frame, swap direct page, RTL in
//   $80:F7F7  player_collide       the player's; jump-tables on the other's id
//   $80:F950  player_collide_hurt  the entry 1,225 of 1,225 of them land on
//   $81:8888  enemy_collide        an enemy's; the mirror image of the player's
//   $81:FE0E  shot_collide         a weapon shot's; four ids stop it, the rest
//                                  it flies through
//   $83:A364  victim_collide       a victim's; eight ids, eight endings, latched
//
// **That list is a snapshot, not the inventory.** It was written when it was
// complete and the dispatch chain in `thread_call_handler` has grown past it
// several times since — there are twenty-five addresses in that chain now, and
// the `else if` ladder is the only place they are all written down. A round was
// planned off this comment once, on the strength of its saying "five"; read the
// code below it instead.
//
// ## Why this is where the direct page stops being pinned
//
// `docs/frame-skeleton.md` recorded that direct page is `$0000` for the whole
// game. That is true of the scheduler, NMI and every routine ported before this
// one — and false here. `$80:84A2  TCD` installs the *target thread's* page,
// read from a 24-entry table at `$80:82DE`, before entering its handler. So a
// handler's `LDA $70` is not `$7E:0070`; it is offset `$70` into that thread's
// own 128-byte page, somewhere in `$7E:0100-$7E:0CFF`.
//
// That is the answer to a question PROGRESS.md has been carrying since Phase 2:
// **an actor's state is its thread's direct page.** There is no separate actor
// slot table. The fields below are the ones these two handlers touch, and they
// are offsets from `D`, not WRAM addresses — which is why they are named here
// and not in `port/wram.h`, and why none of them is in `tools/symbols/zamn.sym`
// (a symbol file keyed by absolute address has nowhere to put them).
//
// ## What this port covers, and what it declines
//
// Every handler is ported through every outcome any movie has reached: the
// player's hit path (`$80:F950`) in full, the enemy's "not my kind of collision"
// early-out, the enemy's acting branch as far as dying — which is the one
// outcome `movies/level1-rescue.zmv` produces — and all of `shot_collide` and
// `victim_collide`, both of which are small enough to be here whole.
//
// **The audio wall is down.** Two jump-table entries used to stop here because
// they open with `JSL apu_play_sfx` and nobody had decided how port code drives
// the APU. `port/apu.h` is that decision, and both are ported: `$80:F92D`,
// whose entire reaction is a noise, and `$80:F87B`, the player's side of a
// pickup — a BCD add into an inventory counter, capped at `$0999`, which is the
// arithmetic that was stuck behind the noise.
//
// `$80:F87B` also has a **tail call**: a player who picks something up while
// holding no weapon falls into `$80:EA63`, which selects one for them. That is
// ported too, in `port/player.h`, because following the census there is what
// turned up the fact that `B` cycles weapons.
//
// Two collision ids (`$81:83C6`, `$81:847E`) have routines of their own, and no
// input has produced either, so both decline by name and wait for a movie rather
// than for code. An enemy that *survives* a hit used to be on that list;
// `movies/level53.zmv` reached it and `$81:8506` is ported below.
//
// Port code: libc only.

// lived — takes *the same entry* out of `$4A` as well:
//
//     $81:9934  STA $2A                 ; health, and it survived

// STA $4A` refills it to 15 every time it empties. What emptying it buys is at

//

// collision-id table, so this address and that table are one weapon's shot code
// laid out back to back.
//
// **What it means is that this shot does not react to anything it hits.** The

// carries on, which is what a weapon that costs five shots a pickup should do.
//

// went in — every one of them claimed, and every one of them checked on every
// call. `$82:F1C2` is the cautionary opposite: no `CLC` and no `SEC` there

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// The eighth copy of `$81:8888`, and the one that answers the question four of
// the others left open.
//
// `$81:B41C`, `$81:D7F6`, `$81:9B6B` and `$81:9063` all end a death with a bare
// decrement of some word on their own page instead of paying an award, and every
// one of those words was named for where it lives — `B41C_DP_COUNTER_0A`,
// `D9B6B_DP_COUNTER_26`, `D9063_DP_COUNTER_2E` — because nothing in reach reads
// them. **Here the reader is eleven instructions away and unambiguous**, and what
// it turns out to be is not a count at all:
//
//     $81:D2AD  LDA $0C : BEQ <loop top>    ; zero: keep running
//               BPL $D2CE                   ; positive: leave, quietly
//               ; negative: LDX #$0200 : LDA $36 : BEQ +$14 : JSL score_add
//               ;           INC $1F84 : ... : JSL $81:8191
//     $81:D2CE  ; ...both endings free the slot
//
// So `$0C` is a **three-way verdict word** that the handler writes and the body
// reads on its next pass: nought means carry on, positive means stop, negative
// means die — and the award this family "does not pay" is paid, `$0200` of it,
// by the actor's own main loop out of the id the handler parked. The death is
// still a `DEC` in the handler; what the `DEC` is *for* is a message.
//
// **That is evidence about the other four and not proof**, and the distinction is
// the same one `enemy_d7f6_collide` drew about `$0A`: those are different words on
// different pages with different writers, and one of them (`$81:B41C`'s) has a
// second writer this one does not. What has changed is that the shape now has one
// worked example instead of none.
//
// Two more things are worth knowing before reading the code.
//
// **It is immune to the ordinary weapon.** After masking, `CMP #$005C : BEQ` sends
// the player's basic shot — the id that is *every* hit in the corpus — straight to
// a `CLC : RTL`. No other copy does that; in all seven of the others `$5C` is the
// index-zero entry of `ENEMY_DAMAGE_TABLE` and costs a point. It parks the id at
// `$36` on the way past, so the shot is noticed and then ignored.
//
// **And `$FF` is how it is told to stop.** `CMP #$00FF : BEQ` is the *first*
// instruction, ahead of the family's `CMP #$005C`, and what it does is `INC $0C`
// — the positive verdict, the quiet exit. That is the same id `actor_deeb_collide`
// latches on and the same one `victim_a264_collide` calls `A264_ID_GIVE_UP_FF`, so
// three unrelated actors read `$FF` as "you are done here". **All three calls any
// input in the corpus makes to this handler are that one id**, which is the honest
// counterweight to everything above: one branch of eight is diffed and seven are
// transcribed.
#define ENEMY_D301_COLLIDE_ENTRY 0x81d301u

// The id that means "stop", tested ahead of everything else and answered with
// the positive verdict. `DEEB_ID_STOP` and `A264_ID_GIVE_UP_FF` are the same
// number reached by two other actors, which is three readings of `$FF` that agree
// and no routine anywhere that produces it yet.

//
// **The eighth is `D301_DP_HIT_ID`**, and this header does not claim to know

// Burning a budget executes no instructions — `snes_runCycles` drives the PPU,
// the APU and the timers, and the CPU is driven separately by
// `snes_runCpuCycle` — so an NMI that falls due inside a burn is not *taken*
// inside it. `cpu->nmiWanted` is a single bool, so a burn long enough to cross
// two vblank boundaries silently collapses two of the game's NMIs into one, and
// a burn of any length hands the handler to the core late.
//
// So the budget is spent with the CPU parked on the routine's own entry
// instruction, in pieces, and stopped the moment an interrupt comes due. The
// core then takes it from that instruction — which is exactly where the ROM's
// version of the routine would have been — runs the handler through the normal
// loop, and `RTI`s back to the entry instruction, where the rest of the budget
// is spent. Nothing about this is specific to long routines; it is the same
// code path for a 92-cycle one, which simply never stops early.
// Video boundaries also stop the budget, even with NMI disabled, so the caller
// of `cosim_frame` can present each completed picture before continuing it.

// is. A routine which publishes work to the NMI by writing a queue count last

// scanlines. The one path that enters it for far longer — a data-set
// upload's back-to-back commands — never comes through here: `$80:CCC8` and
// the uploader are substituted with the wait in their trace (`HW_WAIT8`),
// made read by read on the ROM's cycles. This hook is what `apu_play_sfx` and
// the collision handlers that call it use.
//
// The loop is still written to burn the machine's time rather than the APU's,
// with `snes_runCycles` and not `apu_runCycles`. Two reasons, and the first holds
// whether or not the body ever runs: fast-forwarding the APU alone moves it
// forward without moving `snes->cycles`, which puts the APU on a different clock
// from the rest of the machine — the last thing lockstep wants. And the second is
// what the ROM's `CPY $2143 : BNE` actually buys for the price of its two
// instructions: the beam moves, HDMA fires, the APU catches up, and an NMI comes
// due if one is due. It runs no CPU opcodes, which is right — the only opcodes
// the ROM would have run here are the two this loop stands in for. That it is
// *still* not enough for an upload is exactly the finding.
//
// HDMA fires only if something answers it. The core raises a request once a
// scanline, as one bool, and each of the ROM's reads answers it through
// `dma_handleDma`; `snes_runCycles` alone does not. So a wait across many lines
// did one line's transfer and dropped the rest, and the table fell behind for
// the rest of the frame: the survivor radar's dimmed box slid down under its
// frame and flashed. It did on every frame a sound effect had to wait, 94 of 6,996
// ticks of level 11 with the radar up and the weed whacker cutting plants, up
// to 46 lines lost, where now the box is on the stock lines on all of them. The
// same hole `burn_slice` closes, below. Each piece of the wait now answers
// whatever came due in it, as the read that ends it would, and a piece is
// shorter than a scanline so none is missed. A request is set in the horizontal
// blank, and 32 cycles late is still inside it.
//

// fixed one, which is always in the frontend) can span a dozen scanlines, and
// the request it is answering is that same single bool: every line after the
// first went without its transfer, and the table fell that many lines behind

 * line start (where NMI/vblank can change), DRAM refresh, PPU/HDMA events and
 * explicit recorded hardware events.  snes_runCycles() already preserves the
 * PPU/HDMA positions internally; this helper only makes sure we never hide the

// Four things can, and they are not equally strong — which is the point of
// separating them:
//
//   * a scratch byte the routine's descriptor declares the port does not write;
//   * a byte a substituted call is *known* to have left stale, because the
//     ROM's version would have pushed there. Native mode marks these as it
//     goes, from the push footprint `verify` measured, so the set is exactly
//     the bytes some real substitution skipped;
//   * `nmi_saved_sp`, which is not state at all — see below;
//   * any byte in the stack area at all.
//
// That last rule is a region, not a derivation, and it is deliberately the
// weakest thing here. Stack residue compounds: the port pushes nothing, so a
// substituted call leaves two bytes stale, and every later push and pop at a
// different depth reshuffles which *other* dead bytes the two machines disagree
// about. Tracking that exactly would mean modelling each of the 24 thread
// stacks' live extents, which buys nothing — no code reads below its own stack
// pointer.
//
// What it costs is real and worth stating plainly: inside the stack area this
// run proves nothing. Everything outside it — 126 KB of actual game state — is
// compared byte for byte, and `verify` covers the routines' behaviour exactly,
// stack included.
//
// `nmi_saved_sp` is the narrow one, and it is exempt for a reason no other
// address in WRAM has: **its whole lifetime is one interrupt.** `$80:819C`
// writes it with `TSC : STA $04` and `$80:81EB` reads it back with
// `LDA $04 : TCS` seventy-nine bytes later, and nothing else in the game reads
// it — so at a sync point, between two NMIs, it is not live state, it is a
// fossil of *where the last NMI happened to land*. A substituted routine
// returns on a cycle budget rather than by executing the original instructions,
// so the two cores reach any given point a few cycles apart and NMI catches one
// of them a call deeper than the other. That is real drift and it is worth

    // `level53.zmv` the pass that parts took 176,883,258 cycles stock and
    // 177,280,750 native: 495 frames, against 357,368 for the pass before it.
    // That is where the comparison ends on every movie in this corpus, and the
    // report above prints both lengths so it no longer has to be guessed at.
    //
    // **Two routines end thirty-nine of the forty-three.** Substituting
    // `lzss_decompress` alone reproduces 393,026 of level 53's 397,492 cycles
    // of drift — 98.9%, all of it inside that one pass — while over the other
    // 1,173 passes it is 32 cycles out in total. `camera_follow` alone does the
    // same to the six `level21` movies, which `-x lzss_decompress` does not move
    // at all. Exclude both and 39 of the 43 run their movie to the end; across
    // the corpus, compared scheduler passes go from 42,980 to 172,647.
    //
    // The four that are left are `level25`, `-2p`, `-heavy` and `-lane`, and
    // they are a different thing entirely — the only ones in the corpus that
    // part the way this comment used to say they all did. `level25` parts at
    // pass 1,972 on a pass of 491,628 cycles stock against 461,972 native, 1.38
    // frames and 1.29, with the accumulated drift at -69,790. That is a busy
    // gameplay pass genuinely sitting on the boundary, tipped by the models
    // being tens of thousands of cycles cheap — and it is the one case here
    // where a better model is the fix.
    //
    // **It is not decided by tens of cycles**, which is what this comment used
    // to say. Take 200,000 off the five budgets and the drift moves by two, from
    // 393,026 to 393,028, and the pass overruns exactly as before. Somewhere
    // between 350,000 and 400,000 — about a frame — it stops overrunning, and
    // the parting then moves to a different pass rather than going away. So what
    // the load contains is a wait that quantises in frames, and the cost model
    // does not decide the drift: it decides which side of one boundary a
    // 55-million-cycle decompression finishes on.
    //
    // (The five calls on level 1 took 1,692,780 / 6,476,638 / 10,031,990 /
    // 13,661,234 / 26,981,846 cycles against the ROM's own 1,692,786 /
    // 6,476,668 / 10,032,038 / 13,661,174 / 26,981,744 — six cycles out on the
    // first and a hundred and two on the last. That is still the model's error
    // and it is still that small. It is simply not what ends the run.)
    //
    // So for the level loads — which is 39 of the 43 — the window is not a
    // cost-model problem and no achievable model accuracy buys it back. That is
    // the conclusion this comment reached before, now for a measured reason
    // instead of a supposed one, and narrowed: it holds for the loads and not
    // for the four gameplay partings above, which is the distinction it was
    // missing. `-x` is the switch that separates them.
    //
    // Nothing can be realigned. Aligning on `$16` costs the lagging side an
    // extra scheduler pass, which puts `sched_tick` out by one instead: the two
    // clocks genuinely disagree, because one core really did run a pass in two
    // frames and the other in one. They are not computing different answers,
    // they are running different timelines of the same game — the difference
    // between a console that dropped a frame and one that did not.
    //
    // So the comparison stops here and says so. Everything before this point is
    // a real result; everything after would be frame N against frame N+1. Both
    // cores keep running, because the call counts, coverage and census below are
    // still worth having.
    //
    // Comparing anyway, once, to see what it looks like now that the models are
    // what they are: 162 bytes at the parting and up to 255 later, against 16
    // before it. Not thousands, and recognisably a frame rather than a fault —
    // `$16` off by one, and the counters downstream of it off by one with it.
    // But it is a real divergence, not an artefact: an extra NMI means an extra
    // `thread_tick_waits`, so a sleeping thread wakes a tick early and the game
    // goes on differing from there. There is no filter that keeps the frame out
    // and lets a wrong answer through, which is what would be needed.
    // Once parted, permanently: the counters can come back level later if the
    // other side overruns too, and comparing then would be worse than not
    // comparing at all — the frame numbers would agree while the game states
    // behind them had spent a hundred frames apart.

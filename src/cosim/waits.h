// The ROM's busy-wait loops: instructions the 65816 executes that are not work.
//
// This table exists because *every* measure of "how much of the game runs
// natively" needs a denominator, and the naive denominator is wrong in a way
// that flatters nobody. A 65816 going round `BIT $00C8 : BPL` a hundred
// thousand times is a CPU with nothing to do until the next VBlank. Left in the
// denominator it makes the port's share look smaller than it is; left in a
// ranking of what to port next it puts a two-instruction loop at the top, where
// porting it would achieve exactly nothing — the C would have to spin on the
// same flag.
//
// Each site was found by reading the disassembly of a routine that a ranking had
// put near the top, and each is checked against a profile rather than assumed:
// `$80:9F9D` is nine instructions long and 19,289,582 of the 19,289,827
// instructions credited to it are the first two below.
//
// **This is the one copy.** `tools/native_share.py` parses this file rather than
// keeping its own list — it used to keep one, and a table maintained in two
// languages is a table that disagrees with itself. The regex it uses wants the
// `{0x......, N, "..."}` shape below, one site per line, so keep that shape.
//
// `span` is how many ROM bytes the loop occupies, counted from `addr`. An
// instruction belongs to the site when its opcode byte falls in
// `[addr, addr + span)`, which is the same rule the profiler's byte-range sum
// applies, so the two measures mean the same thing.
//
// Harness code, not port code — this is a fact about the ROM the port is
// replacing, and nothing in `src/port/` may know it.

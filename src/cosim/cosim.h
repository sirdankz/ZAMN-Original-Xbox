// Phase 3 co-simulation harness.
//
// The problem this solves: we want to replace ZAMN's 65816 routines with C, one
// at a time, and *know* — not hope — that each replacement behaves identically.
// PLAN.md calls for the zelda3 answer: run the original ROM under the reference
// emulator and the C reimplementation together, and assert the state stays
// byte-identical.
//
// Phase 2 already built this pattern five times over, in miniature. Each
// `zamn_assets verify-*` command plays a movie under the core, intercepts one
// ROM routine, re-runs the C port on the arguments the ROM was called with, and
// diffs the result. This is that, generalised: a registry of ported routines
// and one engine that can drive them three ways.
//
// ## The three modes
//
// **Verify** (`COSIM_VERIFY`) is the correctness instrument, and the one whose
// results mean the most. At the routine's entry the harness snapshots WRAM and
// the registers, lets the *ROM* run the routine to its return, snapshots again,
// then rewinds the snapshot and runs the C port on it. It diffs all 128 KB of
// WRAM plus the registers. The ROM is doing the driving throughout, so nothing
// about the game's execution or its timing is perturbed — a divergence is
// entirely the port's fault, which is what makes the signal clean.
//
// **Native** (`COSIM_NATIVE`) actually substitutes. At the entry PC the harness
// runs the C port against the emulator's own WRAM, writes the result registers
// into the CPU, burns a cycle budget standing in for the work the ROM would
// have done, and jumps the PC to the routine's own `RTS`/`RTL` so the core
// performs a normal return. The ROM's instructions never execute. This is the
// seam the finished port grows out of.
//
// **Lockstep** (`cosim_lockstep`) is how native mode gets checked: two cores,
// same movie, one stock and one with routines substituted, with all of WRAM
// compared at every frame boundary. It is the whole-program version of what
// verify does per call — and, unlike verify, it *is* sensitive to timing, since
// a native routine returns on a cycle budget rather than by executing the
// original instructions. See `docs/cosim.md`.
//
// This header is harness code, not port code: it may use the emulator. The
// routines it drives live in `src/port/`, which may not.

// for each routine unpacks the first three fields on the way in and fills them
// on the way out.
//
// Flags are opt-in. Modelling N/Z/C exactly means reading whichever instruction
// happened to fall last in the routine, which is real work with no payoff for a
// routine whose callers never branch on the result. `flags` says which ones the
// shim actually modelled, and the report prints it, so the claim stays exactly
// as strong as the evidence.
// `V` is here for one routine and it was `run` that asked for it, not `verify`.
// `$80:9D39`'s `ADC` is the only arithmetic in the port whose overflow output
// outlives the call: the scheduler pushes `P` onto a thread's stack, so the bit
// becomes a byte of WRAM that the whole-program diff compares. Substituting the
// generator without publishing V left that byte differing by exactly `$40` —
// once on level 9, once on level 29, on movies where every other byte matched.

// way round -- `$80:9E7B` bounds its loop with `CPX $CE` -- so there the count
// really is the publishing word and the span is two bytes.
//
// `add` is the difference between `INC $0C` and `STA $12A0,X`, and it is not a

  // command back, and substituting it used to mean not waiting at all. The
  // trace can wait now (`HW_WAIT8`), read by read on the ROM's cycles, so it
  // is substituted, and so is the uploader above it.
  //
  // **The reason a routine lands here now is call volume.** `cycles` is one constant standing
  // in for a distribution — `lzss_read_byte` really costs anywhere from 98 to
  // 298 — and that is harmless while the errors are independent and few. The two
  // LZSS leaves are neither: they are called 1,071,108 times across the corpus,
  // almost all of it inside a single multi-frame decompression, and the error
  // correlates with the data rather than cancelling against it. Substituted, a
  // level load finishes three frames off, which is enough to move every input a
  // movie applies by frame index afterwards.
  //
  // No budget fixes that, and the failed attempt is the argument: the mean is
  // the mean *by construction*, so if a mean could make the totals agree it
  // already would. What is left over is variance, and a constant has none. So
  // these are verified on every call — 107,678 of them, all 128 KB compared —
  // and never substituted, which keeps the frontend's framebuffer check honest
  // for the other fifty-six.
  bool verify_only;

  // ...and the mirror of it, which is the first piece of Phase 4 in this file.
  //
  // `verify_only` means *checked on every call and never substituted*. This
  // means *substituted and never checked per call*, and the routine it was
  // added for is `$80:C05A sprite_cache_init`: 0.97 of a frame of `memset`, so
  // an NMI lands inside virtually every call and `verify` abandons all of them.
  //
  // **The thing worth being precise about is that those are two different
  // failures.** An interrupt breaks *rewind-and-replay*: the ROM's NMI handler
  // wrote WRAM inside the call window, and the port models the routine rather
  // than the handler, so the diff would be reporting the harness's problem as
  // the port's. It breaks nothing about substitution — under `run` the ROM
  // never executes the routine, so there is no window to land inside. The core
  // waits at the instruction after the `JSL` while the budget is burned, and
  // takes any NMI that falls due exactly as it would have.
  //
  // So a `run_only` routine is not unchecked. It is checked by a different
  // claim: `run` compares all 128 KB of WRAM once per scheduler pass, so what
  // stands behind it is *the stretch containing it agreed*, not *the call
  // agreed*. That is a weaker claim per call and a broader one per movie, and
  // it is the claim Phase 4 has to be built on anyway — a port that owns its own
  // main loop has no per-call boundary left to rewind to.
  //
  // Two conditions before anything else gets this flag, and both are the point
  // rather than paperwork:
  //
  //   * **`verify` must be unable to score it, not merely unwilling.** The
  //     reason has to be structural — an interrupt, or a body that outlives a
  //     frame — and the interrupted count in a `verify` report is the evidence.
  //     A routine that could be checked per call and is not is just unchecked.
  //   * **`.cycles` must be a count, not a mean.** Every other entry's budget is
  //     an average `verify` measured; there is no measurement here, so the
  //     figure has to come from the instruction stream instead. `$80:C05A` has
  //     no data dependence and one loop with a known trip count, so
  //     `tools/cycles816.py` prices it exactly. A routine whose cost varies with
  //     its input cannot honestly be given a constant nobody watched.
  //
  // `tools/native_share.py` no longer lists such an address in `BLOCKED`: the
  // share it earns is real on the `run` side of the report and zero on the
  // `verify` side, and the report says which.
  bool run_only;

  // --- The words this routine publishes to the NMI ---------------------------
  //
  // A ported routine runs atomically and the ROM's version does not. Where that
  // shows is a routine which writes a payload and then one word that *publishes*
  // it -- a queue's slot and then its count, four parallel arrays and then their
  // cursor. The NMI handler reads that word to decide whether there is a job
  // waiting, so an interrupt landing between the payload and the publish sees no
  // job, while the same interrupt landing anywhere inside the port's budget sees
  // one already queued. `$7E:000C` came back `$03` against the ROM's `$04` for
  // exactly that reason; see "Sizing the atomicity hazard" in docs/cosim.md.
  //
  // Naming the word here is what lets the harness hold it back. The port writes
  // it as it always did, `run_native` puts the old value straight back, and
  // `burn_spend` publishes it once the budget is spent -- which is where the
  // ROM's own store falls, because in all ten routines that need this the
  // publishing write is the last one the routine makes. That makes the ordering
  // exact rather than approximate, and it costs the routines nothing: none of
  // them know it is happening.
  //
  // Spans are in the order the ROM writes them.

  // --- Routines that do not return ---------------------------------------------
  //
  // `thread_yield` is entered by one thread and leaves into another, by an
  // `RTL` through a stack that is not the one it was called on. A vblank
  // dispatcher leaves into a job by pushing an address and executing `RTL`,
  // and the job comes back to an address inside it. Neither ends where its
  // caller's return address says, so neither fits `ret_op`.
  //
  // So a routine may name its **exits** instead: the instructions of its own
  // that control leaves it by. The port stops on one and says which in
  // `CosimRegs::pc`, and hands over the whole register set -- the stack
  // pointer, the direct page, the data bank and the status byte as well as A,
  // X and Y -- because an exit like that can change all of them. The core then
  // executes the exit instruction itself, the same as `ret_op`.
  //
  // The entry does not have to be a subroutine's. `$80:8401` is where a job
  // returns into the dispatcher; `$80:8372` is the instruction after the
  // scheduler's `WAI`. Any instruction the ROM reaches is an entry the harness
  // can take, and for these it is the only kind there is.
  //
  // What it means for the other two instruments:
  //
  //   * `verify` ends the call when the ROM reaches any of the exits, and
  //     compares every register as well as WRAM and the exit taken. The port
  //     writes the stack as the ROM does, so no dead stack is waived at all.
  //   * `run` publishes everything but the program counter at once, spends the
  //     budget parked on the entry, and moves the program counter to the exit
  //     when the budget is spent. An interrupt taken while parked is taken on
  //     the stack the routine left, which is how the ROM's own instructions
  //     would have met it: after the pushes.

// symptom was not a failed diff but a framebuffer: substituted, `level25-2p`
// parts from the stock core around frame 2,700, because a routine that runs
// every frame and is wrong by thousands of cycles moves the rest of the machine.
//
// No constant fixes that, and the shape of the failure is the argument. The mean
// is the mean *by construction*, so if some constant could make the totals agree
// the measured one already would; what is left over is variance, and a constant
// has none. The routine, on the other hand, knows exactly what it did — it just
// did it — so it can say. A shim calls this from inside `run` with the cost of
// the particular call, and native mode burns that instead of the constant.
//
// Two rules, and they are what keep this a measurement rather than a fudge:
//
//   * **The number is the ROM's own instruction cycles and excludes DRAM
//     refresh.** The core adds 40 whenever a run of cycles crosses the end of a
//     scanline, and where those land is a property of the machine's clock, not
//     of the call. So a reported cost is burned in per-access pieces and the
//     core inserts refresh wherever it falls due, exactly as it did while the
//     ROM's own instructions were executing. (A declared `cycles` constant is
//     burned in one piece, as it always was: it was *measured* refresh-inclusive,
//     so chunking it would count refresh twice.)
//
//   * **It is checked on every call.** `verify` already knows what the ROM's
//     instructions really cost, so a reported cost is diffed against that and
//     the report prints the error — see `CosimStat::model_err_min`. A model
//     nobody checks is a guess with a struct around it.
//

// gets `cycles`, and one that can only price some of its paths can report on
// those and stay silent on the rest.
